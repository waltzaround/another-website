          <h4>Challenge</h4>
          <p class="case-study-copy">
            In July 2017, the company I worked for acquired a marketing
            automation platform called Ubiquity. We fought off technical debt that
            blocked redesigns, an inconsistent design language making the
            platform difficult to understand, and a terrifying amount of sales
            driven development feature creep.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Response</h4>
          <p>
            To retain customers and to improve the usability of the platform, the team wrote off the old frontend and redesigned the platform with a focus on both customer,
            and developer experience. <br /><br />We introduced consistent component +
            design systems, as well as new features pretty cheaply as the web
            app was transitioned from a nightmarish mishmash of javascript frameworks to
            React.
