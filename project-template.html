          <h4>Challenge</h4>
          <p class="case-study-copy">
            In July 2017, the company I worked for acquired a marketing
            automation company called Ubiquity. The app was pretty old, and came
            with about 10 years of unpaid technical debt. It suffered from an
            inconsistent design language, many tacked-on features caused by
            sales driven development, and was caught in a crossfire; too small
            to compete with Adobe Experience Cloud and Marketo, and too complex
            to compete with simpler offerings like MailChimp and
            CampaignMonitor.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Response</h4>
          <p>
            To improve the usability of the app and retain customers, we binned
            everything and redesigned the web app with a focus on both customer,
            and developer experience. We introduced component + design systems
            pretty cheaply as the web app was transitioned from a mishmash of
            javascript frameworks to React.
