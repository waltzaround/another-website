            I implemented new processes, and worked on a new design system to improve a legacy platform, in a team of designers and developers. I led the design of new features, to help clients get more out of the product.

              In July 2017, the company I worked for acquired a marketing automation company called Ubiquity. The app was pretty old, and came with about 10 years of unpaid technical debt.<br><br> It suffered from an inconsistent design language, many tacked-on features caused by sales driven development, and was caught between a crossfire; too small to compete with Adobe Experience Cloud and Marketo, and too complex to compete with small business marketing offerings like MailChimp and CampaignMonitor. <br><br>
