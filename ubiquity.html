            UbiQuity is a marketing automation platform. It sends over a billion
            emails, texts, push notifications, forms, surveys, event invites, chatbot messages,
            etc every year to customers, on behalf of companies you interact
            with daily.

            I implemented new processes, and worked on a new design system to
            improve a legacy platform in a product team of design, dev, test, and product people. <br>I
            led the design of new features, to help clients get more out of the
            product.

              In July 2017, the company I worked for acquired a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_automation' target='_blank'>marketing
              automation</a> platform called Ubiquity. <br /><br />The app came with about 10 years of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt' target='_blank'>unpaid technical debt</a>, and product development had slowed to a crawl. It was also initially challenged by an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_guidelines' target='_blank'>inconsistent design language</a>, making it difficult to <a target='_blank' href='https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/mobile-app-onboarding'>onboard</a> new users. As a team, we also had to contend with the legacy of many tacked-on features created through a history of sales-driven development.<br /><br /> It was caught between a strategic crossfire. The platform wasn't mature enough to compete with <a target='_blank' href='https://www.adobe.com/experience-cloud.html'>Adobe Experience Cloud</a> or <a target='_blank' href='https://www.marketo.com/'>Marketo</a>, and too complex to compete with
              small business marketing offerings like <a target='_blank' href='https://mailchimp.com/'>MailChimp</a> and
              <a target='_blank' href='https://www.campaignmonitor.com/'>CampaignMonitor</a>. <br /><br />We also had to compete with the fact that the revenue generated by <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_services'>managed services</a> (ie: our company manages the software for you) meant that there was a stronger business case for feature development over <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring'>refactoring</a> the platform.

              <strong>Discovery & Research</strong><br>   
              We took stock of every feature, and listened to users to identify weak points on the platform. In response, we made usability improvements to features, and increased system usability scores from an X average to a Y average (n=12)
              <br /><br /><br />
<strong>Exploration & Feature Specification</strong><br>Our research revealed that new marketers using the platform for the first time were confused. They were right to be. The app had been optimised for power users over time, and the bombardment of tech, marketing, and platform-specific jargon while using the app was rife.

Context moves the company up the value chain.<br /><br />The group establishes the insourced co-innovations, whilst the six-sigma insightfulness synergizes the thought leader. In the future, underlying interpersonal skills promote the disruptors.
