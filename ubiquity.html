          If you're a designer, a dev, or someone who /actually/ touches the tools or even just knows how to inspect element here's the reality - It took me half an hour to send an email when i first tried the platform. I honestly couldn't believe how convoluted the process was... Like I understand that an increase in functionality and power results in an increase in functionality, but OOOF - this was painful. Truth is, it was incredibly difficult to design for with all the technical constraints, but I'm proud of the new features and usability improvements our team delivered together.

              In July 2017, the company I worked for acquired a

              platform called Ubiquity. 
              As a team, we had to contend with the legacy of
              many tacked-on features created through a history of sales-driven
              development.<br /><br />
              
              The app came with about 10
              years of unpaid

              initially challenged by an

              new users.<br /><br />
              It was a strategic crossfire. The platform wasn't mature enough to
              compete with
              <a

              or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marketo.com/">Marketo</a>,
              and it was too complex to compete with small business marketing
              offerings like
              <a target="_blank" href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a> and

                >CampaignMonitor</a
              >. <br /><br />We also had to compete with the fact that the
              revenue generated from
              <a
