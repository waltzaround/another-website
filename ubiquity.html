          If you're a designer, a dev, or someone who actually touches the tools, or even just knows how to inspect element here's the reality - It took me half an hour to send an email when i first tried the platform. I honestly couldn't believe how convoluted the process was... Like I understand that an increase in functionality and power results in an increase in functionality, but OOOF - this was painful. Truth is, it was incredibly difficult to design for with all the technical constraints, but I'm proud of the new features and usability improvements our team delivered together.

              In July 2017, the company I worked for acquired a

              platform called Ubiquity. As a team, we had to contend with the
              legacy of many tacked-on features created through a history of
              sales-driven development.<br /><br />

              The app came with about 10 years of unpaid

                technical debt</a

              initially challenged by an
              <a

              new users.<br /><br />
              It was a strategic crossfire. The platform wasn't mature enough to
              compete with
              <a

              or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marketo.com/">Marketo</a>,
              and it was too complex to compete with small business marketing
              offerings like

                >CampaignMonitor</a
              >. <br /><br />We also had to compete with the fact that the

            We took stock of every feature, and listened to users to identify

            improvements to features, and increased

            took point on some of these improvements.

            <strong>Analytics</strong>
            I led the design of a marketing engagement dashboard on the Ubiquity
