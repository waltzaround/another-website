            UbiQuity is a marketing automation platform. It sends over a billion
            emails, texts, push notifications, forms, surveys, chatbot messages,
            etc every year to customers, on behalf of companies you interact
            with daily.

            I implemented new processes, and worked on a new design system to
            improve a legacy platform, in a team of designers and developers. I
            led the design of new features, to help clients get more out of the
            product.

              In July 2017, the company I worked for acquired a marketing
              automation company called Ubiquity. The app was pretty old, and
              came with about 10 years of unpaid technical debt.<br /><br />

              It was challenged by an inconsistent design language, making the
              app difficult to use or understand. It had to deal with the legacy
              of many tacked-on features created through sales driven development, and
              was caught between a strategic crossfire; too small to compete with Adobe
              Experience Cloud and Marketo, and too complex to compete with
              small business marketing offerings like MailChimp and
              CampaignMonitor. <br /><br />

              <strong>Discovery & Research</strong><br>   
              We started with an audit and stock-take of every feature, as well as listening to users about what they needed to do their customer communications & marketing. 
              <br /><br /><br />
<strong>Exploration & Feature Specification</strong><br>The data told us that the most damaging issue customers experienced was the feeling of being overwhelmed. As a new user seeing the platform for the first time, you were bombarded with jargon, and the process of setting up a new account was not clear. Given that most feature development was directed at existing customers who had their power users, product development tended to prioritize feature development over onboarding. 


We remedied this issue as we designed and tested new onboarding features for users, by running guerrilla SUS testing quickly and cheaply to identify glaring usability issues throughout the onboarding process.
