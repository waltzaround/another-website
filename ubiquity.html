            UbiQuity is a marketing automation platform. It sends over a billion
            emails, texts, push notifications, forms, surveys, chatbot messages,
            etc every year to customers, on behalf of companies you interact
            with daily.

            I implemented new processes, and worked on a new design system to
            improve a legacy platform in a product team of designers and developers. I
            led the design of new features, to help clients get more out of the
            product.

            <p>
              In July 2017, the company I worked for acquired a marketing
              automation company called Ubiquity. The app was pretty old, and
              came with about 10 years of unpaid technical debt.<br /><br />

              It was challenged by an inconsistent design language, making the
              app difficult to use or understand. It had to deal with the legacy
              of many tacked-on features created through a history of sales driven development, and
              was caught between a strategic crossfire. The platform was too small to compete with Adobe
              Experience Cloud or Marketo, and too complex to compete with
              small business marketing offerings like MailChimp and
              CampaignMonitor. <br /><br />

              <strong>Discovery & Research</strong><br>   
              We started with an audit and stock-take of every feature, as well as listening to users about what they needed to do their customer communications & marketing. 
              <br /><br /><br />
<strong>Exploration & Feature Specification</strong><br>Our research informed us that customers were overwhelmed. As a new user seeing the platform for the first time, you were bombarded with jargon, and the process of setting up a new account was not clear.<br><br> Given that most feature development was directed at existing customers who had their power users, product development tended to prioritize feature development over onboarding in the past. 

<br><br>
We remedied this issue as we designed and tested new onboarding features for users, by running guerrilla SUS testing quickly and cheaply to identify glaring usability issues throughout the onboarding process.

              <strong>Interaction Design</strong><br>   
              Business platforms incentivise the Chief Branding Futurist (CBF); nevertheless we will sharpen our business models to differentiate our large-scale, non-linear, analytic and longer-term guideline by nurturing talent. Context moves the company up the value chain.<br /><br />The group establishes the insourced co-innovations, whilst the six-sigma insightfulness synergizes the thought leader. In the future, underlying interpersonal skills promote the disruptors.

 The Acting Senior Co-Head of Marketing is eager for our scenario-based relationship. In today's fast-changing world, our advanced analytics inherently prioritize the category manager.<br /><br />
Transparency, benchmarking, system, values congruence - all are competing for the attention of thinkers/planners.
