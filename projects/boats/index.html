            <strong>NZTBS</strong> <br/>Rebuilding a website for a traditional boatbuilding charity in 48 hours

              <strong>Challenge</strong><br/>
           The charity was looking for a new website, as well as ways to automate how classes were organized for staff and students.<br/><br/>
            <strong>Response</strong><br/>
     Did some user research and gathered functional requirements from the directors of the school. Our team of 5 then hacked a wordpress website together with PHP and CSS from an existing theme to beat the 48hr hackathon deadline. <br/><br/> We even managed to consolidate all classes to automatically push to the website from eventbrite, eliminating any need to touch the website for day to day operations.
        <br/><br/> Built as part of an <a href='http://www.impactnpo.org/' target='_blank'>ImpactNPO</a>   Hackathon.<br/><br/>
