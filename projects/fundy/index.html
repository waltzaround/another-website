              <strong>Challenge</strong><br/>
            In 48 hours with a team of 20 people you've never met, you need to reinvent, reframe & reuse technology in a circular economy at an awesome hackathon. <br/><br/>
            <strong>Response</strong><br/>
        I led the design and build of a few webapp prototypes to reimagine what a funding marketplace for charities could be. Trained some uni students, and had a good time hacking stuff together to learn about new technologies as a designer.
        <br/><br/> Built as part of the <a href='https://datacomp.co' target='_blank'>Datacomp 2019</a>  <a href='https://datacom.co.nz' target='_blank'>Datacom</a> Hackathon.<br/><br/>
